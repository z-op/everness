---@alias NodeDef NodeDefAbstract | NodeDefMtgFarming

---Node definition. Used by `minetest.register_node`.
---@class NodeDefAbstract
---@field name string
---@field next_plant string|nil
---@field liquidtype 'none'|'source'|'flowing' specifies liquid flowing physics, "none": no liquid flowing physics, "source": spawns flowing liquid nodes at all 4 sides and below; recommended drawtype: "liquid". "flowing": spawned from source, spawns more flowing liquid nodes around it until `liquid_range` is reached; will drain out without a source; recommended drawtype: "flowingliquid". If it's "source" or "flowing" and `liquid_range > 0`, then both `liquid_alternative_*` fields must be specified
---@field on_rightclick fun(pos: Vector, node: NodeDef, clicker: ObjectRef, itemstack: ItemStack, pointed_thing?: PointedThingDef): ItemStack default: nil, Called when clicker (an ObjectRef) used the 'place/build' key not neccessarily an actual rightclick) while pointing at the node at pos with 'node' being the node table. itemstack will hold clicker's wielded item. Shall return the leftover itemstack. Note: pointed_thing can be nil, if a mod calls this function. This function does not get triggered by clients <=0.4.16 if the "formspec" node metadata field is set.
---@field place_param2 number Value for param2 that is set when player places node
---@field param2 number Value for param2 that is set when player places node
---@field buildable_to boolean If true, placed nodes can replace this node. default: `false`
---@field tiles string|NodeTilesDef Textures of node; +Y, -Y, +X, -X, +Z, -Z. List can be shortened to needed length.
---@field sound NodeSoundDef Definition of node sounds to be played at various events.
---@field drawtype NodeDrawTypes
---@field liquid_viscosity number|integer Controls speed at which the liquid spreads/flows (max. 7).
-- 0 is fastest, 7 is slowest. By default, this also slows down movement of players inside the node (can be overridden using `move_resistance`)
---@field walkable boolean If true, objects collide with node.
---@field after_dig_node fun(pos: Vector, oldnode: NodeDef, oldmetadata: table, digger: ObjectRef): nil  oldmetadata is in table format. Called after destructing node when node was dug using minetest.node_dig / minetest.dig_node., default: nil
---@field paramtype2 string
---@field palette string Image

---Textures of node; +Y, -Y, +X, -X, +Z, -Z. List can be shortened to needed length.
---@class NodeTilesDef
---@field name string
---@field animation TileAnimationDef
---@field backface_culling boolean backface culling enabled by default for most nodes
---@field align_style 'node'|'world'|'user' align style determines whether the texture will be rotated with the node or kept aligned with its surroundings. "user" means that client setting will be used, similar to `glasslike_framed_optional`. Note: supported by solid nodes and nodeboxes only.
---@field scale number|integer scale is used to make texture span several (exactly `scale`) nodes, instead of just one, in each direction. Works for world-aligned textures only. Note that as the effect is applied on per-mapblock basis, `16` should be equally divisible by `scale` or you may get wrong results.
---@field color ColorSpec the texture's color will be multiplied with this color. the tile's color overrides the owning node's color in all cases.

---There are a bunch of different looking node types. `*_optional` drawtypes need less rendering time if deactivated (always client-side).
---@alias NodeDrawTypes
---| '"normal"' # A node-sized cube.
---| '"airlike"' # Invisible, uses no texture.
---| '"liquid"' # The cubic source node for a liquid. Faces bordering to the same node are never rendered. Connects to node specified in `liquid_alternative_flowing`. Use `backface_culling = false` for the tiles you want to make visible when inside the node.
---| '"flowingliquid"' # The flowing version of a liquid, appears with various heights and slopes. Faces bordering to the same node are never rendered. Connects to node specified in `liquid_alternative_source`. Node textures are defined with `special_tiles` where the first tile is for the top and bottom faces and the second tile is for the side faces. `tiles` is used for the item/inventory/wield image rendering. Use `backface_culling = false` for the special tiles you want to make visible when inside the node
---| '"glasslike"' # Often used for partially-transparent nodes. Only external sides of textures are visible.
---| '"glasslike_framed"' # All face-connected nodes are drawn as one volume within a surrounding frame. The frame appearance is generated from the edges of the first texture specified in `tiles`. The width of the edges used are 1/16th of texture size: 1 pixel for 16x16, 2 pixels for 32x32 etc. The glass 'shine' (or other desired detail) on each node face is supplied by the second texture specified in `tiles`.
---| '"glasslike_framed_optional"' # This switches between the above 2 drawtypes according to the menu setting 'Connected Glass'.
---| '"allfaces"' # Often used for partially-transparent nodes. External and internal sides of textures are visible.
---| '"allfaces_optional"' # Often used for leaves nodes. This switches between `normal`, `glasslike` and `allfaces` according to the menu setting: Opaque Leaves / Simple Leaves / Fancy Leaves. With 'Simple Leaves' selected, the texture specified in `special_tiles` is used instead, if present. This allows a visually thicker texture to be used to compensate for how `glasslike` reduces visual thickness.
---| '"torchlike"' # A single vertical texture. If `paramtype2="[color]wallmounted"`: If placed on top of a node, uses the first texture specified in `tiles`. If placed against the underside of a node, uses the second texture specified in `tiles`. If placed on the side of a node, uses the third texture specified in `tiles` and is perpendicular to that node. If `paramtype2="none"`: Will be rendered as if placed on top of a node (see above) and only the first texture is used.
---| '"signlike"' # A single texture parallel to, and mounted against, the top, underside or side of a node. If `paramtype2="[color]wallmounted"`, it rotates according to `param2` If `par
---| '"plantlike"' # Two vertical and diagonal textures at right-angles to each other. See `paramtype2 = "meshoptions"` above for other options.
---| '"firelike"' # When above a flat surface, appears as 6 textures, the central 2 as `plantlike` plus 4 more surrounding those. If not above a surface the central 2 do not appear, but the texture appears against the faces of surrounding nodes if they are present.
---| '"fencelike"' # A 3D model suitable for a wooden fence. One placed node appears as a single vertical post. Adjacently-placed nodes cause horizontal bars to appear between them.
---| '"raillike"' # Often used for tracks for mining carts. Requires 4 textures to be specified in `tiles`, in order: Straight, curved, t-junction, crossing. Each placed node automatically switches to a suitable rotated texture determined by the adjacent `raillike` nodes, in order to create a continuous track network. Becomes a sloping node if placed against stepped nodes.
---| '"nodebox"' # Often used for stairs and slabs. Allows defining nodes consisting of an arbitrary number of boxes. See [Node boxes] below for more information.
---| '"mesh"' # Uses models for nodes. Tiles should hold model materials textures. Only static meshes are implemented. For supported model formats see Irrlicht engine documentation.
---| '"plantlike_rooted"' # Enables underwater `plantlike` without air bubbles around the nodes. Consists of a base cube at the co-ordinates of the node plus a `plantlike` extension above If `paramtype2="leveled", the `plantlike` extension has a height of `param2 / 16` nodes, otherwise it's the height of 1 node If `paramtype2="wallmounted"`, the `plantlike` extension will be at one of the corresponding 6 sides of the base cube. Also, the base cube rotates like a `normal` cube would The `plantlike` extension visually passes through any nodes above the base cube without affecting them. The base cube texture tiles are defined as normal, the `plantlike` extension uses the defined special tile, for example: `special_tiles = {{name = "default_papyrus.png"}},`
